 		<p>Fat is an outsider, a stranger on a thin body.</p> <p>Thin is perceived as the insider within a fat body, assumed to be the natural state for bodies. The excess fat is an overrun boundary, an excess of skin beyond the line society draws on the individual. While the language is abstract, concrete examples are not hard to come by: <p>the size of airplane, theater, or stadium seats,</p><p> the capability of medical equipment,</p><p> the availability and market of clothing sizes.</p> All are catered to a body without large amounts of excess. The bigger one gets, the further they recede from inclusion in a thin-centered world.</p>

  		<div class = "text"><p>I have experienced visceral discomfort and antagonism because of having a fat body. I have experienced and at times believed cultural reinforcement dismissing my legitimacy as a person. It is clear I should view myself as outside the desirable normalcy of bodies. Most importantly, this is both my fault and responsibility to fix.</p>

  		<div class = "text"><p>There is no solid border between fat and thin, making constant external reinforcement of fat's otherness necessary to define the desirable body. Uncertainty over one's status in relation to this can create intense feelings of shame, and internal vilification of the fat on their body. If perceived to have a fat body (which can be generally described as anybody with any excess fat), it is the fault and responsibility of that individual to contain themselves, to return to their true thin state, to go from out-of-shape to in-shape. Until this happens, fat bodies are unlivable. </p>

  		<div class = "text"><p>'Aesthetically, fat is the antithesis of the beauty ideal of the day: tight, lean, and toned. Viewed, then, as both unhealthy and unattractive, fat people are widely represented in popular culture and in interpersonal interactions as revolting: they are agents of abhorrence and disgust.'

  		<div class = "text"><p>As fat bodies are supposed to have no identity or value, claiming a 'fat identity' becomes a conscious political choice. This is achieved when the individual refuses to reject the fat on their frame. The consequences can be extraordinary: 'The self, the person who one is, is presumptively thin: and the hard-won realization that one can live as a fat subject is nothing short of transformative.' Fat identity is the process of reclaiming the identity and subjectivity of an individual when there should be none; a transformation indeed. </p>

  		<div class = "text"><p> A fat identity is a wondrous creation, as it can only be called into being by the fat individual themselves. No amount of external abjection, of recoiling from an overrun boundary, can make a fat identity less legitimate to the individual. Power is taken out of the hands of the thin by refusing to acknowledge the basis of their superiority. Given how prevalent thin normativity is, to do so is an inherently political act. </p>
